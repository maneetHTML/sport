                2. Both Ice and field hockey are among the most favourite sports in the world.

                In the US, Canada, and Northern Europe, ice hockey receives a great deal of attention, which is no different from other regions.
                
                Globally, about 2 billion people follow hockey, especially the National Hockey League (NHL).
                
                The male and female hockey league also receives considerable attention from brands such as Gatorade, Reebok, and others, who are willing to sign sponsorship deals with these teams.
